# oil_price_analysis

This is a project I proposed for Data Science study. For the initial
exploration of the crude oil price history.

We can do a simple regression to see the long term trend of the oil
price (shown in Figure_1).

We can see some similarity between current and at the old time around
1980 by amplifying and shifting the data such that the peak in 1980
maps to the peak in 2008.
